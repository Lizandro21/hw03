# Personal Portfolio
---
Inside the master branch I have all the code inside the index file on how I made my portfolio. It also includes the assets folder which has my css file and my images.
---
I included the first week homework as one of my works done. I also included two homework videos I did a few years back for my freshman year of high school. Those were both as my media showcase.
---
I decided to go with a teal to show my favorite color.
---
All links are working and send you to the proper place. All nav links send you down to the right spot as well. I added contacts at the bottom as well for my github and my email.
