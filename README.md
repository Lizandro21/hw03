# Password Generator
---
Inside the master branch I have all the code from the index file, to the css and javascript sheets. These contain all the working code. 
---
I was running into problems trying to set up a promt for when you pressed the button. I figured out how to add a button on the webpage to pick and choose if you would like things in the password but that was one of the things that really had me struggling.
---
The password generator works and can give you passwords from 8-128 characters contain uppercase, lowercase and symbols.
---
Password generator buttons works and everything was succesful.
